    "Stuffing everything I need into a backpack, I take one last look at my room, knowing that I will never come back here."

    "It truly felt like a long time since I became an Infected. The analysis by Azazel. Being friends with Alice, Bob, and Chris."

    "It felt as though I lived my whole life like this. The life of a merchant, by comparison, felt so alien."

    vig1 "A newcomer, you say? I see. In that case, perhaps a proper education is in order, eh?"

    "This punk spotted me. Great. With a twisted grin on his face, and his arms crossed, he almost appears as though to be watching my every move."

    vig1 "Wow, and you're just going to stand there and watch as your fellow Infected rat gets beaten to death? Haven't your ma and pa taught you anything?"

    vig2 "Did you forget normal people would never give birth to an Infected? Poor sod was probably disowned."

    vig1 "Ignorin' me? You have guts. Let's see how long that lasts... NOW!"

    "Almost in an instant, the vigilante turns and slams the metal rod at the ground."

    "It was clear he deliberately missed the Infected and simply wanted to show some sort of supremacy."

    vig1 "Yeah, now I'm pissed. You little shits have no right to even exist. Why trash like you continue to infest our world is beyond me."

    vig1 "But that's okay. Allow me to do my civil duty to society by taking out the trash."

    "This vigilante looks crazed. Bloodthirsty, even. Almost as though such things come naturally."

    "The vigilante has begun to kick the Infected. The Infected initially cried out, but then stopped."

    "The other vigilantes looked in glee, as if entertained by the spectacle."

    "Some of them point and laugh. Some looked amused. A couple are even egging each other on. One decided to join in on the fun."

    "And one decided to focus on me. Still watching my actions."
