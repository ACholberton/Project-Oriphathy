    "Alice looks distracted. She looks at the horizon with a dazed look."
    "I turned towards Bob and Chris. They too look dazed."

    b "Is something wrong?"

    "I ended up breaking the silence."

    g "Ah, sorry. I was just thinking."

    b "Um..."

    show chris neutral

    c "Ah, sorry. I suppose everyone's Arts are different from person to person."

    c "In my case, I can somewhat detect when a Catastrophe will happen."

    c "It's not accurate, but..."

    d "In this case, it may be. Something about the air doesn't sit well with me."

    "The Catastrophe."
    "Nicknamed as such to refer to various natural disasters occuring around the world."
    "It is believed that Catastrophes occur whenever Originium is found, almost as if they are connected."
    "Because these Catastrophes are unpredictable, certain technologies were created to adapt to such a situation."
    "For example, moving cities and attempts to predict these Catastrophes."

    hide bob yikes
    b "And you think the Catastrophe is going to happen here?"

    show chris neutral

    c "Probably. I can't say."

    hide chris neutral

    "I feel as though I'm stating the obvious, but Catastrophes are dangerous. With the technology to predict Catastrophes, evacuation orders tend to follow."
    "However, as far as any of us know, no such order was made for Chernobog."


    b "So are we leaving pretty soon?"

    show alice neutral

    g "Is there anywhere we can go?"

    hide alice neutral

    c "I heard Columbia is the only place that will still welcome the Infected. The problem is, we'll need money."

    b "I think I can cover the costs. I was a merchant, you know."

    g "Okay. Should we meet up somewhere next week? We'll definitely need some time to organize our stuff and decide what to bring with us."

    hide alice neutral

    c "Yeah, that might be a good idea."

    c "Okay. Let's meet up in front of the mall next week at night."

    "The four of us went our separate ways afterwards."
    "On my part, I'll have to try and gather up all of my funding. Since we're planning to go to Columbia, we'll definitely need it."

    "But even so, the looming Catastrophe..."
    "Something about this one doesn't feel right. Natural. This one seems... manmade."

    b "..."

    "I woke up earlier than usual. Tonight is the time we're leaving, after all."
    "I spent much of my morning gathering and packing my things."
    "I have managed to secure more of the funding that I have lost, though I could not get all of it."
    "I am thankful for my connections who haven't abandoned me yet. Though the funds are not the ideal amount, they are still better than nothing."
    "Moreover, if they provided too much help, people will start asking... questions."
    "No doubt they want to avoid looking like Infected symphasizers."
    "Stuffing everything I need into a backpack, I take one last look at my room, knowing that I will never come back here."
    "It truly felt like a long time since I became an Infected. The analysis by Azazel. Being friends with Alice, Bob, and Chris."
    "It felt as though I lived my whole life like this. The life of a merchant, by comparison, felt so alien."
    "I quietly left my room. I hope the next person who uses it will treat it well."
    "........."

    scene Dark alley
    with fade

    "Cloudy skies. Possible chance of rain at this time of day. This never bodes well. Even as a merchant, cloudy skies seem to represent a potential failed deal."

    "But I am not a merchant anymore. Such details no longer matter to me."
    "Maybe I can restart my career as a merchant once we reach Columbia."
    "I headed down the alleyway I usually go on the way to meet up with the rest."

    f "Hey! The hell are you doing here, you filthy Infected?!"

    "A thunderous roar caught me off guard. However, that roar was not directed at me."
    "I peeked from behind the wall, observing the situation."
    "Apparently an Infected was spotted out on the streets. Looks like they were caught by people who look like witch hunters."
    "The poor Infected was surrounded by these vigilantes. He looks terrified."

    "Well well. What do we have here? A filthy Infected."
