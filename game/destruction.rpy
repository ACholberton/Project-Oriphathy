    "The Catastrophe."
    "Nicknamed as such to refer to various natural disasters occuring around the world."
    "It is believed that Catastrophes occur whenever Originium is found, almost as if they are connected."
    "Because these Catastrophes are unpredictable, certain technologies were created to adapt to such a situation."
    "For example, moving cities and attempts to predict these Catastrophes."

    c "Probably. I can't say."

    hide chris neutral

    "I feel as though I'm stating the obvious, but Catastrophes are dangerous. With the technology to predict Catastrophes, evacuation orders tend to follow."

    "I am thankful for my connections who haven't abandoned me yet. Though the funds are not the ideal amount, they are still better than nothing."
    "Moreover, if they provided too much help, people will start asking... questions."
    "No doubt they want to avoid looking like Infected symphasizers."
    "Stuffing everything I need into a backpack, I take one last look at my room, knowing that I will never come back here."
    "It truly felt like a long time since I became an Infected. The analysis by Azazel. Being friends with Alice, Bob, and Chris."
    "It felt as though I lived my whole life like this. The life of a merchant, by comparison, felt so alien."
    "I quietly left my room. I hope the next person who uses it will treat it well."

    "Maybe I can restart my career as a merchant once we reach Columbia."
    "I headed down the alleyway I usually go on the way to meet up with the rest."

    "The witch hunter pounded his fists. Another cracked their knuckles."

    hide Vigilante

    "This is a daily occurance to the Infected. No one ever bothers to help us."

    "And naturally, if I'd stepped in, it would only worsen the situation."

    "This punk spotted me. Great. With a twisted grin on his face, and his arms crossed, he almost appears as though to be watching my every move."

    h "Wow, and you're just going to stand there and watch as your fellow Infected rat gets beaten to death? Haven't your ma and pa taught you anything?"

    i "Did you forget normal people would never give birth to an Infected? Poor sod was probably disowned."

    h "Yeah, now I'm pissed. You little shits have no right to even exist. Why trash like you continue to infest our world is beyond me."

    h "But that's okay. Allow me to do my civil duty to society by taking out the trash."

    hide Vigilante

    "This witch hunter looks crazed. Bloodthirsty, even. Almost as though such things come naturally."

    "The witch hunter continues to kick the Infected. The Infected initially cried out, but then stopped."

    "The other witch hunters looked in glee, as if entertained by the spectacle."

    "Some of them point and laugh. Some looked amused. A couple are even egging each other on. One decided to join in on the fun."

    "And one decided to focus on me. Still watching my actions."
