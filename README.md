## What is a Visual Novel?
A visual novel, often abbreviated as VN, is an interactive literary genre, which originated in Japan, featuring text-based story with narrative style of literature and interactivity aided by static or sprite-based visuals, most often using anime-style art or occasionally live-action stills.

## What is Project Oripathy?
Project Oripathy is a visual novel fangame based on the existing mobile game Arknights. It tells a story loosely based on the events of Arknights, though no knowledge of Arknights or the story behind it is needed as any relevant terms are explained in the game.

As this is a visual novel, the gameplay is a simple click through text, with some opportunities for player choices and inputs to be selected, which will affect the event, and ultimately the ending the player will receive.
