## What is a Visual Novel?
A visual novel, often abbreviated as VN, is an interactive literary genre, which originated in Japan, featuring text-based story with narrative style of literature and interactivity aided by static or sprite-based visuals, most often using anime-style art or occasionally live-action stills.

## What is Project Oripathy?
Project Oripathy is a visual novel fangame based on the existing mobile game Arknights. It tells a story loosely based on the events of Arknights, though no knowledge of Arknights or the story behind it is needed as any relevant terms are explained in the game.

As this is a visual novel, the gameplay is a simple click through text, with some opportunities for player choices and inputs to be selected, which will affect the event, and ultimately the ending the player will receive.

## Why Project Oripathy?
As stated above, Project Oripathy is based on Arknights. As fellow fans of the mobile game, this visual novel is a way for us to contribute to the expanding community and fanmade content that Arknights has cultivated. We made every effort to research the game's storytelling to tailor our story such that there would be no inconsistencies. The idea behind it is to feel as though our story is considered canon (that is, official), yet at the same time standalone such that Project Oripathy does not require understanding of Arknights to appreciate and enjoy. Moreover, we aimed to tailor the story in a way where the player feels as though they are a relevant part of the story, rather than a mere audience.

Your actions have consequences. Will you own up to your choices, or push them away?
